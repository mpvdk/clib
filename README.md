# C standard library

This repo contains custom implementations of the c standard library.

I'm making it as a personal exercise to test and expand my knowledge of C. It is not meant to replace
implementations like glibc, which will most certainly be faster and more reliable.

# Status

Below you'll find a list of all the components of the C standard library and their status within
this project.

Some of these are not very interesting and me be removed from the to-do list later if they're not
very educational.
